V-Ray | Softimage 1.6 release notes
===================================

Contents:

1. Uninstalling V-Ray | Softimage
2. Empty Softimage preview window displayed instead of VFB preview
3. Demo version limitations
4. Changes and improvements in this version since 1.5 Official Release



=================================
1. Uninstalling V-Ray | Softimage

Prior to uninstalling the V-Ray | Softimage .xsiaddon file, you need to ensure that no rendering jobs
are in progress, that the VFB window is not open, that no render regions are active, and that the material 
manager window is closed.

On some earlier versions of the platform, attempting to uninstall the V-Ray add-on directly may result
in a crash. To avoid this, you must ensure that the V-Ray plugin is stopped before attempting to uninstall.

To stop the V-Ray plugin:
* Choose File | Plug-in Manager... from the Softimage menu
* Navigate to User Root -> V-Ray (Addon) -> Plug-ins (this is in the Tree tab)
* Right-click on V-Ray (plugin) and choose Unload. The V-Ray plugin is now stopped.

An alternative approach via script (also usable in batch mode, e.g. in a render farm environment)
* Issue the following script command, substituting the exact path to V-Ray on the target machine:
  UnloadPlugin "C:\Users\<<User>>\Autodesk\Softimage_<<V1>>\Addons\V-Ray\Application\Plugins\vray4xsi<<V2>>.dll
  (substitute V1 and V2 with the appropriate name for your version of the host platform)

Now that the plug-in is stopped, you can successfully invoke the Uninstall command to remove it.

For extra safety (especially if you have used beta versions, demo builds, etc.) please manually remove
any leftover files after the automatic uninstall. To do so, open the folder named
       C:\Users\<<Your Name>>\Autodesk\Softimage_<<V1>>\Addons\V-Ray
and delete any files and nested folders.



==================================================================
2. Empty Softimage preview window displayed instead of VFB preview

In certain cases, when you click the Preview button on the SI render bar (and you have chosen the VFB
as your preview instrument), the Softimage built-in preview window will appear with nothing in it.
Normally, when the VFB option is turned on (default), this window stays minimized at the bottom of the screen.

This issue is related to the interaction between SI and V-Ray. The best workaround is to simply close the
SI previw window, then click Preview again. VFB will appear and show the preview as expected.



===========================
3. Demo version limitations

The following limitations apply to the V-Ray | SI demo version (demo build):

* Renders and preview renders are limited to a size of 640x450 pixels. Attempting to set up wider or
  taller output scene sizes will result in an error being displayed in the Output window, and the render
  will be aborted

* If the scene contains more than 5 lights, only the first five will be exported and rendered (or previewed)

* A watermark will appear on all renders and previews, in the upper left portion of the image
